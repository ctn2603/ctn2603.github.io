					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>First, I learned colors play an important role in a specific website. Second, I realized that W3C developed a standard for enhancing color accessibility, which web designers should follow. Lastly, I learned a website should incorporate texture or patterns besides colors to help people with visual impairment understand the data better.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>"Add enough contrast" was my favorite part of the article. It taught me about the 4.5:1 background-to-text contrast ratio, which I didn't know before. Furthermore, this section attaches links to great resources such as W3C's minimum AA rating, Colorable, and ColorSafe. I visited ColorSafe and really loved what the website provides.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude." (Justin Reyna)</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>I love this article and give it a 9 since I learned how important colors are on the website. The other reason is that it provides me with useful resources for choosing the right colors.</p>
