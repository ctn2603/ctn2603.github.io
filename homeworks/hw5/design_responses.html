                        <li>
                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>First, I learned that the images should serve the content of the applications or websites and shouldn't be off-topic. Second, when applied appropriately, dynamic UI creates a very good user experience or makes it less boring. Third, I also learned that the way they choose colors and images is so proper that the contrast is very high.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>There isn't any specific section for this reading, all are images, so I assume you ask what my favorite UI was. That is, I loved the Travel Map by Never-stop. First, the animations associated with each user manipulation are perfect, making a good user experience. Second, the UI has a high good contrast, which is easy for users to navigate. Lastly, the images at the bottom are suitable for what the product content wants to convey.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>"Travel Map by Never-stop", "Cryptocurrency â€” Transaction Confirmation by Gal Shir", and "Welcome screen / login by Andrej Radisic" were my favorite inspirations. This's because the dynamic UIs make me want to use applications more often, as well as use the companies' core products. Basically, I think their UIs are perfect, thus the good quality of their products. The interfaces achieved their goal in a unique way by choosing appropriate colors, contrast, and animations. They also organize text and images properly so that users don't feel overwhelmed by their content.</p>

                            <p>I love this article and give it a 10 since all of the UIs are very attractive and eye-catching. They make a very good user experience.</p>
