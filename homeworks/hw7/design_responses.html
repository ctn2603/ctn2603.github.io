					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>First, I learned four Gestalt principles (emergence, reification, multi-stability, invariance). Second, this article taught me how to transform those key principles into practice, especially web design. Lastly, I learned that minor changes in design like symmetry and closure can sometimes make a significant difference.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>"Closure" was my favorite part of the article. This sections perfectly explain how our brain works by combining missing parts of a shape into a complete object. Also, it answers why "closure" can reduce complexity.  I used lots of icons and images like what was in the article but I didn't know.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." (Eleana)</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>I like this article and give it a 9 since it covers minor details and important design concepts which can contribute to a nice and effective website.</p>
