							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>First and foremost, I learned that choosing fonts is very important for a website. Appropriate and simple fonts will better convey the content to the audience. Otherwise, inappropriate and decorative fonts confuse the audience rather than give them information. The other thing I learned regard font pairing, which helps improve readability. Moreover, I particularly loved font-related links which the author incorporated into the article. That is, I visited those links right away and learned what they're for and how to use them.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>"Identify your audience" is my favorite part of the article. It's not a technique-focused section, yet it reminds me of designing my websites purposefully and targeting the right audience. Specifically, if I design a fantastic website and target the proper audience, it will attract them and enhance the user experience. Otherwise, it will be ineffective, and the audience prefer not to use my design.</p>
