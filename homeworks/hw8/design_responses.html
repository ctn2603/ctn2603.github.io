					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>First, I learned the term "dark patterns". I saw lots of dark patterns before yet unable to name them until reading this article. Second, this article taught me different types of dark patterns and how they mislead users. Last but not least, I learned that designers should take ethics into account upon releasing a product.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>"Misdirection" was my favorite part of the article. This section tells me the name of the dark pattern and reminds me of the mistakes I made before. Skype is one of my primary communication channels, which means I often install and update this application. Sometimes, I didn't read the installation options and just basically clicked next, making Bing my default search engine. Of course, I wouldn't like to use it at all.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>"Dark Patterns are deceptive UX/UI interactions, designed to mislead or trick users to make them do something they donâ€™t want to do." (Arushi Jaiswal)</p>
					</li>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p>I like this article yet give it an 8 since it doesn't cover the concepts in depth and clearly explain the solutions to dark patterns.</p>
