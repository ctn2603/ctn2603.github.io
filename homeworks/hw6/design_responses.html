							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>First, I learned the duration and speed of animation should be chosen appropriately, which helps avoid too slow or too fast animations. Second, I realized that easing is particularly important in creating a natural animation. This makes a website more vivid. Lastly, I learned that equal interaction should be obeyed when designing a web application, which helps users stay focused easier.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>"Easing" was my favorite part of the article. I loved the way the article clarified the meaning of linear motion, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out. The author provided excellent graphics to supplement the points he discussed. This made the concepts understandable.</p>
