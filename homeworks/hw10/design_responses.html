							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>Personally, the topic presented in this article is necessary and quite important in building an eye-catching and effective website. Grasping the connection between visual attention and product design will save designers' time and effort. Yes, my design opinion was influenced by this article. Specifically, "selective attention" helps me classify core and supplemental components in a website, paying more attention to users' needs. One example is that I should highlight my core component on a website (I should give significant spacing for the main components, as well as leave them on a black or white background). Another example is using animation to catch users' attention, leading them to the core components of my design.</p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p>I like this article yet give it an 8. This is because the presented psychological concepts are quite theoretical and hard to digest. The examples are not very helpful as well.</p>
